# Django
  
  Django is a free and open source web framework. Djangi is written in Python. A web framework is a set of components which helps to develop websites faster and easier. Django makes the process more modular to ensure easy access and modification. 
  
  When a request comes to a web server, it's passed to Django which tries to figure out what is actually requested. It takes a web page address first and tries to figure out what to do. This part is done by Django's urlresolver. Basically all the urls are contained within 'urls.py'. 
  
  The functions that are associated with each url is written inside the 'views.py' file. The functions are defined according to the request method 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT' and 'DELETE'.
