# Django
  
  Django is a free and open source web framework. Djangi is written in Python. A web framework is a set of components which helps to develop websites faster and easier. Django makes the process more modular to ensure easy access and modification. 
  
  When a request comes to a web server, it's passed to Django which tries to figure out what is actually requested. It takes a web page address first and tries to figure out what to do. This part is done by Django's urlresolver. Basically all the urls are contained within *urls.py*. 
  
  The functions that are associated with each url is written inside the *views.py* file. The functions are defined according to the request method **GET, POST, PUT and DELETE**. 
  
  The *models.py* contains the database tables. A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table. Each model is a Python class that subclasses **django.db.models.Model'**.
